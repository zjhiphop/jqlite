jqlite
======

A super lite jquery version for modern browsers.

### We already have jQuery, why re-invent this module? The reason are:  

* we only support chrome, so we don't have cross browser requirement  
* chrome has many awsome apis for us to populate dom  
* the most frequent opearations are: get/remove/insert/update and make ajax   request etc,  
* it's too heavy to use jquery.  
* faster and lighter than jQuery

__ Please use "ALT + Z" to type "Î©", sorry for unconvinient. __
